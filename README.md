# **iso-version-cmd_vel_mux**
A modified version of Yujin‚Äôs **cmd_vel_mux**:https://wiki.ros.org/cmd_vel_mux.

This version adds **key mode** to meet AMR certification requirements and introduces an **emergency velocity** that can bypass all validation checks and publish velocity commands immediately when critical conditions occur.

##  üß≠ **Overview**
**iso-version-cmd_vel_mux** acts as a velocity command multiplexer that selectively publishes velocity commands to the robot based(like MCU) on their priority and validity.
It adds new safety features and operational states required for **AMR safety certification**, ensuring that only valid and authorized velocity commands are published.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Features**
- **Key Mode Verification** ‚Äî validates operation mode before accepting commands (Manual / Navigation).

- **Emergency Velocity Control** ‚Äî limits or blocks unsafe velocity outputs under abnormal conditions.

- **Priority-based Command Selection** ‚Äî only the highest-priority active command is published.

- **Timeout Detection** ‚Äî stops publishing when input velocity commands are not updated in time.

Diagnostic Integration ‚Äî reports system status through ROS diagnostics for monitoring.


| Parameter | Type | Description |
